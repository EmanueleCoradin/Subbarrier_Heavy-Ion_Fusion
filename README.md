# Subbarrier Heavy-Ion Fusion Cross Section Measurement

### Description:
This repository documents a two-semester experiment conducted at INFN Legnaro labs focusing on measuring subbarrier heavy-ion fusion cross sections. The experiment aims to verify the quantum tunneling effect in complex systems.

### Objective:
Define and measure physical quantities associated with heavy-ion fusion cross sections using carbon beams from the Tandem accelerator at LNL.

### Methodology:
Learn to use silicon and microchannel plate detectors, optimize setup, and conduct measurements. Compare experimental results with theoretical predictions.

### Contents:
- **Code:** Analysis scripts and programs.
- **Materials:** Documentation and resources for experimental setup.
- **Data:** Raw and processed experimental data.
- **Reports:** Project progress and findings.
